## Mock-up

There are a few tools for mock-ups. Paper prototypes (low-tech, but effective and cheap), Digital picture edition software (gimp / photoshop / etc.), or dedicated tools like moqups.com (I'm calling out moqups here in particular since it seems to strike the best balance between "easy-to-use" and "wants your money" -- the free teir isn't perfect, but it should be sufficient for our needs with a little "creative layout" to get around the page-limit)

In this space please either provide images (around 4) showing your prototypes, OR, a link to an online hosted mock-up tool like moqups.com
